Stage D deliverables have been uploaded to [Github](https://github.com/tope018/CSC-440-Project). From our groups understanding, you would like them on our wiki. At the current time, we have not yet learned how to do that (Our markdown includes images, of which are on our local machine). We will add "Add Deliverables to Wiki" as part of the checklist for the next iteration. [2017/11/1]
    
* [[SamCho]] It's OK as long as you are willing to share your artifacts with others. Isn't it better just send the deliverables via email? I already have one team submitted the stage D deliverables. Anyway, please notify me when you are done so that I can give you feedback and evaluate.

## Expectations 

#### ver1 @ 2017/10/28

* D Stage - This stage appears quite easy. Basically just reading the documentation and learn- ing/reviewing python and flask. We will be rotating team leader due to time constraints of team members.
* C Stage - This stage will most likely take the longest time. While not necessarily harder than the other stages, it requires a lot of time commitment to learn the Wiki structure and reverse engineer it using RESTful API. However, this stage will be most beneficial as we will learn a new knowledge management system to use in the future.
* B Stage - This stage will revitalize moral for the project. After spending lots of time learning languages and Wiki, we finally get to use creativity to develop an extension for out Wiki system.
* A Stage - This stage should take the shortest amount of time, as it should just be a python script to manipulate the Wiki system and database.

## Progress
* [2017/10/25] During the first week, our team agreed to work on finishing the homework so we can focus our full time on completing our deadlines for each stage. Our team set up a Trello Board for team communication and a Github repo for hosting our project files. During the course of the next week, we will begin work on Stage D. 

* [2017/11/1] During the second week, our team began learning Python and Flask. We also completed an Agile Retrospective and now have templates for documentation for the other stages. HTML tags have been added to the markdown code just for visual aesthetics, however, if we created some sort of *export pdf* feature, we will have to remove those tags.
